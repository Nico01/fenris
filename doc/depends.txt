Known dependencies for the project:

Required:
---------

  - Linux 2.x
 
    Currently, only Linux is supported, and only 2.x kernels
    (2.0, 2.2, 2.4, 2.5) were tested. Base Linux system configuration,
    including GNU textutils and other basic applications, is assumed.

  - x86 platform

    Currently, only x86 processors are supported. The project may
    be forced to run on a different architecture, but results will
    be meaningless.

  - Bourne-Again SHell

    bash is necessary for compilation scripts. For systems that
    do not have bash, you can try applying a patch supplied in support/
    directory, but it does not have to be very up to date.

  - GNU libc 2.x

    GNU libc 2.x is required for the build process, but Fenris is
    also capable of tracing applications coming from libc5 systems.

  - GNU C Compiler 2.9.x - 3.x

    Required for build, and the only compiler platform supported right
    now for tracing.

  - GNU binutils  [with development headers and libraries]

    Required for libbfd and several build process utilities.
    Note: avoid version mismatch between .h and .a / .so files.

  - GNU gdb

    Required during the build process. Not required for running the
    tracer.

  - OpenSSL or RSA libmd5 [with development headers]

    Required for MD5 hashing and signature recognition.
  

Recommended:
------------

  - libreadline [with development headers]

    Libreadline is recommended for input handling in Aegir. It is
    possible to use Aegir without libreadline installed, but no
    editing / command history capabilities will be present.

  - libtermcap or libtinfo [with headers]

    Required to use libreadline.

  - screen

    Required for running nc-aegir sessions. Nc-aegir tries to provide
    a comprehensive debugging environment, and integrate Fenris and
    Aegir sessions. It does so by using pseudo-terminal switching
    capabilities provided by screen (that would otherwise require two
    terminals or a complex terminal emulation code built-in).

  - graphics-capable web browser

    For viewing ragnarok output.


Optional:
---------

  - xterm

    An alternative session management tool for nc-aegir. When running
    under X Window System, nc-aegir will spawn a new xterm window instead
    of using screen to navigate the display.

  - Sendmail or compatible

    Required for running fenris-bug bug reporting tool.
