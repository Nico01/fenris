Fenris development roadmap - "must-have"s:
------------------------------------------

  0.07:   - all syscalls from doc/TODO list added to Fenris
          - all libcalls from doc/TODO list added to Fenris
          - symbolic names in everything for nc-aegir and Aegir
          - some serious work on making the documentation a bit better
          - configurable tracing inside libraries
          - T_noskip and MAXNEST exceeded problem addressed
          - selective syscall/libcall/fnct reporting
          - work on -G a bit more
          - plus whatever cool ideas we have

  0.08:   - syscall and libcall handlers moved to a separate parsed
            file that uses some smart notation to eliminate
            redundant C code
          - smarter segment matching
          - support line numbers and other stuff from .debug* sections
          - plus whatever cool ideas we have

  0.09:   - new version of Ragnarok, OpenDX?
          - C++ symbol demangling
          - recovery from more errors added
          - new syscall / libcall target list
          - libdisasm review?
          - plus whatever cool ideas we have ;-)
