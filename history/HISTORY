For the first development snapshot I've found on my disk, go to
http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/fenris/vintage.tgz . It is dated
October 2001, and you'll probably find it amusing. The stuff in
this directory is: lunete.conf - some evidence of my really ancient
project that did something remotely similar to Fenris; and some
kernel 2.0 headers for adding new syscalls, ignore them.
