Before (the-binary):

 804bf80:       55                      push   %ebp
[...]
 804bf9c:       0f 84 b6 00 00 00       je     0x804c058

After (new-binary):

0804bf80 <gethostbyname>:
 804bf80:       55                      push   %ebp
[...]
 804bf9c:       0f 84 b6 00 00 00       je     804c058 <gethostbyname+0xd8>

As you can see, libc function names "appeared" in the binary, and you can
now easily distinguish them from the code that belongs to the program;
additionally, you can easily determine what they do and what parameters
they accept.
