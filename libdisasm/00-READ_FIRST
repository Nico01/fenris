Portions of this code are based on libi386 library from 'bastard' project
developed by mammon and few other guys. Please visit their webpage,
http://bastard.sourceforge.net to learn more about this very interesting
project.

This code is derived from release 0.12. Unfortunately, 0.12 had some bugs
I had to fix; I didn't really care about original functionality,
writing new code for functions I needed =)

Modifications include: almost complete rewrite of libdis.c and .h to
fit our expectations; complete rewrite of disasm_addr in i386.c to
fix serious bugs; master table modifications in i386.h; some typecast
bugfixes in i386.c. This code is used to predict memory writes.

I didn't really wanted to touch i386.c and i386.h, so except for
necessary bugfixes and such, both contain tons of unused code and
some really nasty constructions. Do not even try to compile it with
-Wall.

In opcodes2/ subdirectory, you'll find another x86 disassembler
library, derived from from GNU binutils-2.11.93.0.2.
Why is that? Simple - it is more stable. I needed a reliable disassembler
for Aegir. I needed it much more badly than for Fenris itself. And even
thou this code is more stable, it is not suitable for Fenris, where I
need to answer a very simple question - what memory region will be
affected by this command. This libopcodes code from GNU binutils does not
provide this functionality in any reasonable and accessible way. So,
as I don't have time to fix libi386, and don't have what I need in
libopcodes, I decided to use both, as needed.
